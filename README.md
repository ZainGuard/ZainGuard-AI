# ZainGuard AI Platform

An open-source Security Operations (SecOps) AI agent platform designed to automate and enhance cybersecurity tasks through intelligent automation.

## 🚀 Overview

ZainGuard AI Platform is a modular framework that enables security teams to deploy AI agents for various security operations tasks including threat detection, incident response, vulnerability management, and alert triage. The platform is built with extensibility in mind, allowing teams to create custom agents tailored to their specific security needs.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Deploy specialized AI agents for different security tasks
- **Extensible Tool System**: Connect to SIEMs, threat intelligence feeds, ticketing systems, and more
- **Multiple LLM Support**: Compatible with both open-source and proprietary language models
- **RESTful API**: Easy integration with existing security tools and workflows
- **Real-time Processing**: Handle high-volume security events and alerts
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source with active community contributions

## 🏗️ Architecture

The platform consists of several key components:

- **Agent Core**: Central orchestration and management system
- **Tooling Layer**: APIs and connectors for security tools
- **Data Layer**: Vector database and knowledge base for RAG
- **API Gateway**: Centralized interface for all interactions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Access to an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local model via Ollama)

### Installation
